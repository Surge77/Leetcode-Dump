# ðŸ”¹ Problem Name: Pascal's Triangle (Dynamic Programming, Easy)

**ðŸ”— Link:** [LeetCode #118 - Pascal's Triangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle/)
**ðŸŸ¢ Status:** âœ… Solved

## ðŸ”¹Quick Breakdown

* **Difficulty Level:** Easy
* **Main Approach:** Build each row using the previous row (DP)
* **Core Concept:** Dynamic Programming, combinatorics
* **When to Use This Pattern?**
  * Whenever the current answer depends on previous sub-answers (triangular, sequential)
  * Generating triangle/array structures with cumulative sums
* **Mistakes to Avoid:**
  * Forgetting to pad edges (if not using zero-padding)
  * Off-by-one errors in row/col indices
  * Modifying previous row in-place (which corrupts future rows)

## ðŸ”¹ Optimization Path

* **Brute Force:** Generate all combinations for each cell using nCr formula â€” O(numRowsÂ²) but with extra factorial computations (slow, not memory efficient)
* **Optimized Solution:** Use DP (build row by row using previous row) â€” O(numRowsÂ²) time and space
* **Further Improvements Possible?**
  * For just returning the nth row: use O(n) space, iteratively overwriting the row
  * For individual cell queries: direct combinatorial calculation with O(1) extra space

## ðŸ”¹ Solution Breakdown

* **Optimal Approach:**
  * Start with [[1]] as the first row
  * For each new row, pad the previous row with zeros, then sum adjacent pairs to create the next row
  * Append each new row to the result
* **Why This Works?**
  * Every number in Pascal's Triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it
  * Zero-padding means no special edge handling (all out-of-bounds are treated as zero)
* **Edge Cases Considered:**
  * numRows = 1 (should return [[1]])
  * numRows = 0 (should return [])
  * Very large numRows (be careful with memory/time)

## ðŸ”¹ Pattern Recognition

* **Belongs To:** Dynamic Programming (#14 from 15-patterns), also related to combinatorics
* **Common Problems Using This:**
  * Pascalâ€™s Triangle II (return only nth row)
  * Unique Paths (grid DP)
  * Triangle Minimum Path Sum

## ðŸ”¹ Tricks & Patterns Used

* Zero-padding to avoid edge checks
* Bottom-up DP
* Simple list building without extra libraries

## ðŸ”¹ Alternative Data Structures

* For nth row only: Use a 1D list, overwrite in place
* For sparse triangle: Could use dict-of-lists for memory efficiency (rarely needed)

## ðŸ”¹ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(numRowsÂ²)
* **Space Complexity:** O(numRowsÂ²) (for the result triangle)

## ðŸ”¹ Code Snippet (Optimized)

```python
class Solution:
    def generate(self, numRows: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = [[1]] if numRows > 0 else []  # Edge case: zero rows
        for _ in range(numRows - 1):
            prev = [0] + res[-1] + [0]  # Zero-padding for edge uniformity
            row = [prev[j] + prev[j + 1] for j in range(len(res[-1]) + 1)]
            res.append(row)
        return res

# Time: O(numRows^2), Space: O(numRows^2)
```
