**ðŸ”— Link:**[**Leetcode** - **Longest Palindromic Substring**](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/)

**ðŸŸ¢ Status:** âœ… Solved

## ðŸ”¹Quick Breakdown

* **Difficulty Level:** Medium
* **Main Approach:** Expand Around Center
* **Core Concept:** Two Pointers (Opposite-End)
* **When to Use This Pattern?**
  * When asked to find palindromic substrings
  * Symmetry checking in strings
* **Mistakes to Avoid:**
  * Forgetting to check both odd and even length centers
  * Using string slicing inside the loop repeatedly (adds unnecessary space cost)
  * Off-by-one indexing errors

---

## ðŸ”¹ Optimization Path

* **Brute Force:** O(nÂ³)
  * Check all substrings and test if each is a palindrome
* **Optimized Solution:** O(nÂ²) time, O(1) space
  * Expand Around Center with index tracking
* **Further Improvements Possible?**
  * Yes: Manacherâ€™s Algorithm can achieve O(n) time, but is complex and rarely required in interviews

---

## ðŸ”¹ Solution Breakdown

* **Optimal Approach:** Use two pointers to expand around every center (odd and even)
* **Why This Works?**
  * All palindromes are symmetric; by checking outward from each potential center, we cover all possibilities
* **Edge Cases Considered:**
  * Empty string
  * All characters same (e.g., `"aaaaaa"`)
  * Palindrome at start or end
  * No repeating characters

---

## ðŸ”¹ Pattern Recognition

* **Belongs To:** Two Pointers (Opposite-End), Expand Around Center
* **Common Problems Using This:**
  * Palindromic Substrings
  * Valid Palindrome II
  * Longest Palindromic Subsequence *(DP-based)*

---

## ðŸ”¹ Tricks & Patterns Used

* **Expand Around Center**: Check odd (`i,i`) and even (`i,i+1`) centers
* **Use index tracking (`resIdx`, `resLen`)** to avoid extra slicing
* Constant space, clean logic

---

## ðŸ”¹ Alternative Data Structures

* **Can this problem be optimized using a different DS?**
  * Yes, dynamic programming 2D table is another valid approach
* **Example:**
  * `dp[i][j] = True` if `s[i..j]` is a palindrome

---

## ðŸ”¹ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(nÂ²)
  * Expand from each character center, worst-case length expansion
* **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  * No extra memory except a few variables for indices and length

## ðŸ”¹ Code Snippet (Optimized)

```python

class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        resIdx = 0       # Start index of the longest palindrome
        resLen = 0       # Length of the longest palindrome

        for i in range(len(s)):
            # Odd-length palindrome
            l, r = i, i
            while l >= 0 and r < len(s) and s[l] == s[r]:
                if (r - l + 1) > resLen:
                    resIdx = l
                    resLen = r - l + 1
                l -= 1
                r += 1

            # Even-length palindrome
            l, r = i, i + 1
            while l >= 0 and r < len(s) and s[l] == s[r]:
                if (r - l + 1) > resLen:
                    resIdx = l
                    resLen = r - l + 1
                l -= 1
                r += 1

        return s[resIdx : resIdx + resLen]

```
