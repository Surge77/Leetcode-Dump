# ðŸ”¹ Problem Name: Find All Anagrams in a String (Sliding Window, Medium)

**ðŸ”— Link:**[Leetcode 438](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/)

**ðŸŸ¢ Status:** âœ… Solved

## ðŸ”¹Quick Breakdown

* **Difficulty Level:** Medium
* **Main Approach:** Sliding Window + HashMaps
* **Core Concept:** Maintain a sliding frequency count and compare with the pattern's frequency.
* **When to Use This Pattern?** When you need to find matching patterns or substrings across a sliding window.
* **Mistakes to Avoid:**
  * Forgetting to remove characters with zero frequency.
  * Comparing maps without cleaning up zero values.

## ðŸ”¹ Optimization Path

* **Brute Force:** O(nÂ·m), check all substrings of length `m` and compare frequency counts.
* **Optimized Solution:** O(n), using sliding window and constant-time hashmap updates.
* **Further Improvements Possible?** Could use fixed-size arrays (26 elements) instead of dicts for speed when input is lowercase aâ€“z.

## ðŸ”¹ Solution Breakdown

* **Optimal Approach:** Use a sliding window of size `len(p)` and compare character frequencies between `s` and `p`.
* **Why This Works?** Sliding window avoids recomputing the entire substring frequency from scratch for every window shift.
* **Edge Cases Considered:**
  * When `p` is longer than `s`
  * Characters that never appear in `s`

## ðŸ”¹ Pattern Recognition

* **Belongs To:** Sliding Window
* **Common Problems Using This:**
  * Minimum Window Substring
  * Permutation in String
  * Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters

## ðŸ”¹ Tricks & Patterns Used

* **Sliding Window with HashMap Comparison**
* **Cleanup Zeros from HashMap to enable dictionary comparison**

## ðŸ”¹ Alternative Data Structures

* **Can this problem be optimized using a different DS?**
  Yes â€” use fixed-size arrays of length 26 for both `pCount` and `sCount` for better performance.
* **Example:**
  Instead of dicts, use:
  ```python

  pCount = [0] * 26
  sCount = [0] * 26
  ```

## ðŸ”¹ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(n) â€” each character processed once in sliding window
* **Space Complexity:** O(1) â€” at most 26 entries in each dictionary

## ðŸ”¹ Code Snippet (Optimized)

```python

from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findAnagrams(self, s: str, p: str) -> List[int]:
        if len(p) > len(s): return []

        pCount, sCount = {}, {}
        for i in range(len(p)):
            pCount[p[i]] = 1 + pCount.get(p[i], 0)
            sCount[s[i]] = 1 + sCount.get(s[i], 0)

        res = [0] if sCount == pCount else []

        l = 0
        for r in range(len(p), len(s)):
            sCount[s[r]] = 1 + sCount.get(s[r], 0)
            sCount[s[l]] -= 1

            if sCount[s[l]] == 0:
                sCount.pop(s[l])
            l += 1

            if sCount == pCount:
                res.append(l)

        return res

```
