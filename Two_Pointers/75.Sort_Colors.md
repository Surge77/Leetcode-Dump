# 🔹 Problem Name: Sort Colors (Array, Medium)

**🔗 Link:** [LeetCode 75 - Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-05-17)

**🟢 Status:** ✅ Solved

## 🔹Quick Breakdown

* **Difficulty Level:** Medium
* **Main Approach:** Dutch National Flag Algorithm
* **Core Concept:** Two Pointers
* **When to Use This Pattern?**
  * When you need to **sort in-place**
  * When the input contains **a limited set of distinct values** (like 0,1,2)
* **Mistakes to Avoid:**
  * ⚠️ Incrementing `mid` in `case 2` — that’s dangerous!
  * Forgetting that swapped-in elements still need checking
  * Placing the `swap()` method outside the class in Java 😬

---

## 🔹 Optimization Path

* **Brute Force:**
  * Sort using a built-in method → `Arrays.sort()`
  * **Time:** O(n log n)
  * **Space:** O(1)
* **Optimized Solution:**
  * Dutch National Flag → Single-pass
  * **Time:** O(n)
  * **Space:** O(1)
* **Further Improvements Possible?**
  * This is optimal already. You can’t beat O(n) with in-place sorting for this problem.

---

## 🔹 Solution Breakdown

* **Optimal Approach:**
  * Use three pointers (`start`, `mid`, `end`) to partition the array into regions of 0s, 1s, and 2s.
* **Why This Works?**
  * You categorize elements on the fly by swapping them into the correct region.
  * It’s like painting a flag:
    * 🟥 (0s) → left
    * ⚪ (1s) → middle
    * 🟦 (2s) → right
* **Edge Cases Considered:**
  * All same values (all 0s, 1s, or 2s)
  * Already sorted input
  * Reverse sorted input
  * Empty array
  * Only one element

---

## 🔹 Pattern Recognition

* **Belongs To:**
  * Two Pointers
  * (Soft Greedy, because we make real-time decisions)
* **Common Problems Using This:**
  * Move Zeroes (LC 283)
  * Partition Array (LC 912 with 3-way quicksort)
  * Rainbow Sort (variation with k colors)

---

## 🔹 Tricks & Patterns Used

* **Two Pointers + Swap Logic**
* **In-place array manipulation**
* ⚠️ Do **not** blindly increment `mid` — always check what you swapped in.

---

## 🔹 Alternative Data Structures

* **Can this problem be optimized using a different DS?**
  * Sort of — but it’s not necessary
  * Could use a hashmap or counting array (Counting Sort)
* **Example:**
  * Count # of 0s, 1s, and 2s, then overwrite the array
  * **Space:** O(1), **Time:** O(n), but **two passes**

## 🔹 Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(n)
* **Space Complexity:** O(1)

## 🔹 Code Snippet (Optimized - Java)

```java
 0
class Solution {
    public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
        int start = 0, mid = 0, end = nums.length - 1;

        while (mid <= end) {
            switch (nums[mid]) {
                case 0:
                    swap(nums, start, mid);
                    start++;
                    mid++;
                    break;
                case 1:
                    mid++;
                    break;
                case 2:
                    swap(nums, mid, end);
                    end--;  // Don't move mid here!
                    break;
            }
        }
    }

    private void swap(int[] arr, int i, int j) {
        int temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[j];
        arr[j] = temp;
    }
}

```
