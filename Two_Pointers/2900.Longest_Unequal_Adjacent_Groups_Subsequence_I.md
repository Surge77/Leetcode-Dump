# ðŸ”¹ Problem Name: 2900. Longest Unequal Adjacent Groups Subsequence I (Array, Easy)

**ðŸ”— Link:**[LeetCode 2900](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-unequal-adjacent-groups-subsequence-i/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-05-15)

**ðŸŸ¢ Status:** âœ… Solved

## ðŸ”¹Quick Breakdown

* **Difficulty Level:** Easy
* **Main Approach:** Compare current group with previous
* **Core Concept:** Group transitions
* **When to Use This Pattern?** When you need to extract elements based on change in values across consecutive indices
* **Mistakes to Avoid:** Forgetting to include the first element by default; off-by-one errors when comparing `i` and `i - 1`

---

## ðŸ”¹ Optimization Path

* **Brute Force:** Add every element, then filter â€” O(n), but unnecessary overhead
* **Optimized Solution:** O(n) â€” single pass with group comparison
* **Further Improvements Possible?** Not needed for this constraint size

---

## ðŸ”¹ Solution Breakdown

* **Optimal Approach:**
  Iterate through the words, and only add a word if its group ID is different from the previous one.
* **Why This Works?**
  Group transitions mark the boundaries where a new word should be picked. Only the first word of each group matters.
* **Edge Cases Considered:**
  * All words in the same group â†’ Only one word added
  * Each word in a different group â†’ All words added
  * Empty input (though not part of this problemâ€™s constraints)

---

## ðŸ”¹ Pattern Recognition

* **Belongs To:** Two Pointers
* **Common Problems Using This:**
  * Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
  * Group Shifted Strings
  * Word Break based on category switches

---

## ðŸ”¹ Tricks & Patterns Used

* Comparing adjacent elements
* Maintaining clean iteration with `i == 0 || groups[i] != groups[i-1]`
* No extra space used beyond result list

---

## ðŸ”¹ Alternative Data Structures

* **Can this problem be optimized using a different DS?**
  Not necessary â€” no lookup or fast access needed
* **Example:**
  If extended, could use a `Map<Integer, List<String>>` for full group info, but overkill for this version

---

## ðŸ”¹ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(n)
* **Space Complexity:** O(1) (excluding result list)

## ðŸ”¹ Code Snippet (Optimized)

```java

class Solution {
    public List<String> getLongestSubsequence(String[] words, int[] groups) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < words.length; ++i) {
            if (i == 0 || groups[i] != groups[i - 1]) {
                result.add(words[i]);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}

```
