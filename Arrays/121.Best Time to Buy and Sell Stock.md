# üîπ Problem Name: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (Array, Greedy)

**üîó Link:**[Leetcode - 121.Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/description/)
**üü¢ Status:** ‚úÖ Solved

## üîπ Quick Breakdown

* **Difficulty Level:** Easy
* **Main Approach:****Track the lowest price and compute max profit dynamically**
* **Core Concept:****Greedy Algorithm, Kadane‚Äôs Algorithm (Modified)**
* **When to Use This Pattern?**
  * When you need to find the maximum difference **between two elements** while maintaining order.
  * Problems that involve **tracking min/max values** dynamically.
* **Mistakes to Avoid:**
  * Trying to use **nested loops (O(n¬≤)), which is inefficient**.
  * Not updating `buy_price` when encountering a new minimum.
  * Not considering the case where **prices are always decreasing** (profit remains `0`).

## üîπ Optimization Path

* **Brute Force:** O(n¬≤) ‚Üí Try all pairs `(i, j)` where `j > i` and compute `prices[j] - prices[i]`.
* **Optimized Solution:** O(n) ‚Üí **Single-pass greedy approach** tracking the minimum price and max profit.
* **Further Improvements Possible?**
  * This problem **cannot be optimized further beyond O(n)** because we must scan the array at least once.

## üîπ Solution Breakdown

* **Optimal Approach:**
  * **Iterate once** through the array, keeping track of the **lowest price so far** (`buy_price`).
  * If the current price is lower than `buy_price`, update `buy_price`.
  * Otherwise, compute the potential profit (`prices[i] - buy_price`) and update `max_profit`.
* **Why This Works?**
  * This ensures that **we always buy at the lowest possible price** and **sell at the highest** after that.
  * We **never sell before buying** since we update `buy_price` only when we find a lower price.
* **Edge Cases Considered:**
  * **All decreasing prices** (e.g., `[5,4,3,2,1]` ‚Üí Profit = `0`)
  * **All increasing prices** (e.g., `[1,2,3,4,5]` ‚Üí Profit = `max - min`)
  * **Single-element array** (Profit = `0`)

## üîπ Pattern Recognition

* **Belongs To:**
  ‚úÖ **Greedy Algorithm** (always looking for the best decision at each step)
  ‚úÖ **Kadane‚Äôs Algorithm (Modified)** (tracking the minimum and computing max profit)
* **Common Problems Using This:**
  * **LeetCode 53:** Maximum Subarray (Kadane‚Äôs Algorithm)
  * **LeetCode 122:** Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II (Multiple transactions allowed)
  * **LeetCode 123:** Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III (At most 2 transactions)

## üîπ Tricks & Patterns Used

* **Greedy Strategy:** Track min price dynamically and compute max profit.
* **Kadane‚Äôs Modification:** Similar to max subarray sum but tracking **min instead of max**.

## üîπ Alternative Data Structures

* **Can this problem be optimized using a different DS?** ‚ùå **No need for extra DS, O(n) solution is optimal.**
* **Example of unnecessary DS usage:**
  * A **Min-Heap** could store prices, but it adds extra O(log n) complexity.

## üîπ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(n) ‚Üí Single pass through the array.
* **Space Complexity:** O(1) ‚Üí Only a few extra variables used.

## üîπ Code Snippet (Optimized)

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {

        // Track the lowest price encountered so far
        int buy_price = prices[0];
      
        // Track the maximum profit
        int max_profit = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            // Update the buy price if a lower price is found
            if (prices[i] < buy_price) {
                buy_price = prices[i];
            } else {
                // Calculate profit and update max profit
                int current_profit = prices[i] - buy_price;
                max_profit = Math.max(current_profit, max_profit);
            }
        }

        return max_profit;
    }
}

```
