# ðŸ”¹ Problem Name: Count Largest Group (Hashing Simulation, Medium)

**ðŸ”— Link:**[LeetCode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-largest-group/description/)

**ðŸŸ¢ Status:** âœ… Solved

## ðŸ”¹Quick Breakdown

* **Difficulty Level:** Medium
* **Main Approach:** HashMap-based simulation
* **Core Concept:** Grouping, HashMap Frequency Counting
* **When to Use This Pattern?** When elements need to be grouped based on a derived value (digit sum) and we need to count the frequency of each group.
* **Mistakes to Avoid:** Forgetting to update the count of the largest group when the group size changes.

## ðŸ”¹ Optimization Path

* **Brute Force:** O(n^2) â€” Iterate through each number, calculate digit sum, and compare group sizes (inefficient).
* **Optimized Solution:** O(n \* log(n)) â€” Using a HashMap to count the frequency of each sum of digits (efficient).
* **Further Improvements Possible?** Since we're already using a HashMap for efficient lookup and counting, itâ€™s hard to improve beyond this. But further space optimization could be considered.

## ðŸ”¹ Solution Breakdown

* **Optimal Approach:** Iterate through numbers from 1 to n, calculate the digit sum for each number, use a HashMap to count occurrences of each digit sum, and then find the largest group(s).
* **Why This Works?** By grouping numbers based on the sum of their digits, and using the HashMap to efficiently track frequencies, we avoid the need for nested loops. The HashMap provides O(1) time complexity for lookups and updates.
* **Edge Cases Considered:**
  * n = 1 (smallest input, only one number with digit sum of 1).
  * n = 2 (separate groups for 1 and 2).
  * Larger values of n where groups are dynamically changing in size.

## ðŸ”¹ Pattern Recognition

* **Belongs To:** HashMap Simulation / Frequency Counting
* **Common Problems Using This:**
  * Grouping by certain properties (e.g., sum of digits, modulo).
  * Counting frequency of elements (e.g., frequency of elements in a list).

---

## ðŸ”¹ Tricks & Patterns Used

* **Modulo Arithmetic** â€” used in the process of summing digits (using `%` to get digits and `/` to remove them).
* **HashMap for Frequency Counting** â€” stores the sum of digits as the key and the number of occurrences as the value.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Alternative Data Structures

* **Can this problem be optimized using a different DS?**
  * It could use a **Trie** if we were considering character-based grouping (for instance, digit sum of strings).
  * A **List of Groups** could be used, but the HashMap provides better efficiency for lookup and updates.
* **Example:** Using a **Heap** to track the largest groups could be an alternative approach but isnâ€™t needed here as the problem simply asks for the count of largest groups, not the actual groups themselves.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(n \* log(n))
  * Calculating the sum of digits for each number takes O(log(n)) because the number of digits in n is proportional to log(n).
  * We repeat this for all numbers up to n, so the time complexity is O(n \* log(n)).
* **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  * We store the frequencies of each digit sum in a HashMap, which at most will have n different digit sums (although this is highly unlikely).

## ðŸ”¹ Code Snippet (Optimized)

```java

class Solution {
    public int findDigitSum(int num) {
        int sum = 0;
        while (num > 0) {
            sum += num % 10;  // Get the digit at ones place
            num /= 10;       // Remove the digit at ones place
        }
        return sum;
    }

    public int countLargestGroup(int n) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int maxSize = 0;
        int count = 0;

        for (int num = 1; num <= n; num++) {
            int digitSum = findDigitSum(num);

            // Increment frequency of the digit sum
            map.put(digitSum, map.getOrDefault(digitSum, 0) + 1);

            // Check for largest group size
            if (map.get(digitSum) == maxSize) {
                count++;
            } else if (map.get(digitSum) > maxSize) {
                maxSize = map.get(digitSum);
                count = 1;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}

```
