# ðŸ”¹ Problem Name: Invert Binary Tree (Tree, Easy)

**ðŸ”— Link:** [Invert Binary Tree â€“ LeetCode #226](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/)

**ðŸŸ¢ Status:** âœ… Solved

## ðŸ”¹Quick Breakdown

* **Difficulty Level:** Easy
* **Main Approach:** Recursive depth-first traversal
* **Core Concept:** Binary Tree manipulation via recursion
* **When to Use This Pattern?**
  * Anytime you need to apply a swap or mirror operation across an entire tree.
* **Mistakes to Avoid:**
  * Forgetting to swap before recursing.
  * Failing to return the root at the end.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Optimization Path

* **Brute Force:** Build a new tree by inserting mirrored nodes (extra space).
* **Optimized Solution:** In-place recursion swapping children.
* **Further Improvements Possible?**
  * Iterative BFS/DFS using a queue or stack.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Solution Breakdown

* **Optimal Approach:** At each node, swap its left/right pointers, then recurse on each child.
* **Why This Works?** The binary treeâ€™s recursive structure matches a simple post-swap recursion.
* **Edge Cases Considered:**
  * Empty tree (`root is None`)
  * Single-node tree

---

## ðŸ”¹ Pattern Recognition

* **Belongs To:** Tree Traversal (DFS)
* **Common Problems Using This:**
  * Symmetric Tree
  * Tree Serialization/Deserialization

---

## ðŸ”¹ Tricks & Patterns Used

* **Recursive Tree Processing**
* **Post-order Logic (swap then recurse)**

---

## ðŸ”¹ Alternative Data Structures

* **Iterative with Queue (BFS):** Swap children level-by-level.
* **Iterative with Stack (DFS):** Swap as you pop each node.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(n) â€” visits each of the n nodes once.
* **Space Complexity:** O(h) â€” recursion stack up to tree height h (O(log n) balanced, O(n) skewed).

## ðŸ”¹ Code Snippet (Optimized)

```python

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution(object):
    def invertTree(self, root):
        """
        Time Complexity: O(n)
        Space Complexity: O(h)  # h = height of the tree (recursion stack)
        :type root: Optional[TreeNode]
        :rtype: Optional[TreeNode]
        """
        if not root:
            return None

        # Swap children first
        root.left, root.right = root.right, root.left

        # Recurse into subtrees
        self.invertTree(root.left)
        self.invertTree(root.right)
        return root

```
