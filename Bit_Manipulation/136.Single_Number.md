🔹 Problem Name: Single Number (Bit Manipulation, Easy)
🔗 Link: LeetCode 136 - Single Number
🟢 Status: ✅ Solved

🔹 Quick Breakdown
Difficulty Level: Easy

Main Approach: XOR all elements — duplicates cancel out, leaving the unique number.

Core Concept: Bit Manipulation / XOR property.

When to Use This Pattern? When every element appears exactly twice except one.

Mistakes to Avoid:

Using extra structures like sets or maps (wastes space).
Thinking XOR depends on order (it doesn’t).
Forgetting XOR identity (0 ^ x = x).
🔹 Optimization Path
Naive: Nested loops checking counts, O(n^2).
Better: Use HashSet or dictionary, O(n) time, O(n) space.
Optimized Solution (This): XOR trick, O(n) time, O(1) space.
Further Improvements Possible? Not needed; this is already optimal.
🔹 Solution Breakdown
Optimal Approach: XOR all numbers. Since a ^ a = 0 and XOR is commutative and associative, pairs cancel out, leaving only the unique element.

Why This Works? Duplicate numbers vanish through XOR cancellation, leaving the unpaired number.

Edge Cases Considered:

Single-element array.
Large values of integers.
Negative numbers (XOR works regardless).
🔹 Pattern Recognition
Belongs To: Bit Manipulation (XOR Tricks).

Common Problems Using This:

137. Single Number II
138. Single Number III
139. Missing Number
140. Find the Difference
     🔹 Tricks & Patterns Used
     XOR cancellation → pairs reduce to zero.
     XOR identity element (0) → safe initialization.
     Commutativity & associativity → order doesn’t matter.
     🔹 Alternative Data Structures
     HashSet / Counter: Works but uses extra O(n) space.
     Sorting: Identify single number by comparing neighbors, O(n log n).
     🔹 Complexity Analysis
     Time Complexity: O(n).
     Space Complexity: O(1).
     🔹 Code Snippet (Optimized)
     class Solution:
     def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
     res = 0
     for num in nums:
     res ^= num
     return res

# ⏱ Time: O(n)

# 💾 Space: O(1)

✅ Final Takeaway: XOR is the cleanest and most efficient tool to isolate the unique number — minimal code, no extra space, and lightning-fast.
