# ðŸ”¹ Problem Name: 200. Number of Islands (Graph Traversal, Medium)

**ðŸ”— Link:** [LeetCode Problem - 200. Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)  
**ðŸŸ¢ Status:** âœ… Solved

## ðŸ”¹ Quick Breakdown

- **Difficulty Level:** Medium
- **Main Approach:** BFS traversal over grid cells
- **Core Concept:** Flood Fill / Connected Components in a 2D Grid
- **When to Use This Pattern?** When youâ€™re asked to count the number of separate connected groups in a grid (like clusters, islands, or regions).
- **Mistakes to Avoid:** Forgetting to mark visited cells or skipping bounds checks (causes infinite loops).

## ðŸ”¹ Optimization Path

- **Brute Force:** Explore every cell repeatedly â†’ O((mÃ—n)Â²)
- **Optimized Solution:** BFS/DFS to mark visited cells â†’ O(mÃ—n)
- **Further Improvements Possible?** Union-Find for disjoint-set representation (same complexity, more reusable for dynamic problems).

## ðŸ”¹ Solution Breakdown

- **Optimal Approach:** Use BFS to traverse each unvisited land cell ('1') and mark all connected land as water ('0').
- **Why This Works?** Each BFS completely covers one connected component (island). Counting BFS calls = number of islands.
- **Edge Cases Considered:** Empty grid, all water, single-row/column, non-square grids.

## ðŸ”¹ Pattern Recognition

- **Belongs To:** Graph Traversal (Pattern #11)
- **Common Problems Using This:**
    - 695. Max Area of Island
    - 733. Flood Fill
    - 1254. Number of Closed Islands
    - 130. Surrounded Regions
    - 1020. Number of Enclaves

## ðŸ”¹ Tricks & Patterns Used

- BFS queue-based traversal
- In-place marking to avoid extra space
- Direction vectors for 4-way movement

## ðŸ”¹ Alternative Data Structures

- **Union-Find (Disjoint Set):** Can be used to track connected components
- **Example:** Each cell is a node; union adjacent '1's.

## ðŸ”¹ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(m Ã— n) â†’ Each cell is visited once
- **Space Complexity:** O(min(m, n)) â†’ BFS queue in worst case

## ðŸ”¹ Code Snippet (Optimized)

```python
from collections import deque
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        directions = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]]
        ROWS, COLS = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        islands = 0

        def bfs(r, c):
            q = deque()
            grid[r][c] = "0"
            q.append((r, c))

            while q:
                row, col = q.popleft()
                for dr, dc in directions:
                    nr, nc = dr + row, dc + col
                    if (nr < 0 or nc < 0 or nr >= ROWS or
                        nc >= COLS or grid[nr][nc] == "0"):
                        continue
                    q.append((nr, nc))
                    grid[nr][nc] = "0"

        for r in range(ROWS):
            for c in range(COLS):
                if grid[r][c] == "1":
                    bfs(r, c)
                    islands += 1

        return islands
```

## ðŸ“Š ANALYSIS

**Approach:** BFS-based flood fill traversal marking visited nodes.  
**Complexity:** O(mÃ—n) time, O(min(m,n)) space.  
**First Principles:** Treat each land cell as a node, each adjacent land as an edge â†’ count connected components.  
**80/20 Insight:** 80% of grid-based problems reduce to BFS/DFS flood fill with minor tweaks.  
**Misconceptions:** Forgetting to mark cells in-place, assuming diagonal connections count.  
**Five Whys:** Why BFS? To explore all connected neighbors without recursion depth limits.  
**Verdict:** Clean BFS solution, optimal for static grids.  
**Pattern Magic:** Graph Traversal â†’ Flood Fill (Connected Components).  
**Interview Power Move:** Mention both BFS and Union-Find options for versatility.  
**Evolution Complete:** âœ… Foundational graph mastery: connectivity via traversal.
