# ðŸ”¹ Problem Name: Subsets II (Backtracking, Medium)

**ðŸ”— Link:** [LeetCode 90: Subsets II](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets-ii/)
**ðŸŸ¢ Status:** âœ… Solved

## ðŸ”¹Quick Breakdown

* **Difficulty Level:** Medium
* **Main Approach:** Backtracking + Pruning Duplicates
* **Core Concept:** Generate all possible subsets, skip duplicates by sorting and careful index increment
* **When to Use This Pattern?**

  * When asked for all subsets/power set with duplicate elements
  * Classic backtracking, but with the added twist of handling duplicates
* **Mistakes to Avoid:**

  * Not sorting the input (you canâ€™t skip dupes reliably)
  * Forgetting to skip all adjacent duplicates in the recursion
  * Accidentally including duplicate subsets

## ðŸ”¹ Optimization Path

* **Brute Force:** Generate all possible subsets, then filter duplicates afterwards. O(2^N * N), but deduplication is slow/ugly.
* **Optimized Solution:** Sort input, skip adjacent duplicates during backtracking. O(2^N * N), but pruning makes it elegant and correct.
* **Further Improvements Possible?**

  * Using iterative bitmasking + set to dedupe (but not cleaner/faster)
  * Still exponential due to subset explosion, no magic trick here

## ðŸ”¹ Solution Breakdown

* **Optimal Approach:**

  * Sort nums to group duplicates
  * Use backtracking to explore all subset possibilities
  * When you skip including nums[i], skip all subsequent duplicates of nums[i] (i.e., advance i until nums[i] != nums[i+1])
* **Why This Works?**

  * By skipping over duplicate numbers *only when not taking them*, you avoid adding duplicate subsets
* **Edge Cases Considered:**

  * Empty input
  * All elements identical
  * Mix of unique and duplicate values
  * Very large/small numbers

## ðŸ”¹ Pattern Recognition

* **Belongs To:** Backtracking, Subset Generation, Pruning
* **Common Problems Using This:**

  * Permutations II (with duplicates)
  * Combination Sum II
  * All possible unique subsequences

## ðŸ”¹ Tricks & Patterns Used

* Sort-before-backtrack to control duplicates
* Prune recursion by advancing index over equal values

## ðŸ”¹ Alternative Data Structures

* Can this problem be optimized using a different DS? Not really for core logic. Can use set for dedupe, but the pruning method is better.

## ðŸ”¹ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(2^N * N)  # All subsets, each copy/append may cost O(N)
* **Space Complexity:** O(2^N * N) # Storing all subsets; recursion stack is O(N)

## ðŸ”¹ Code Snippet (Optimized)

```python
# Time: O(2^N * N), Space: O(2^N * N)
class Solution:
    def subsetsWithDup(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []
        nums.sort()  # Sorting is mandatory to spot duplicates

        def backtrack(i, subset):
            if i == len(nums):
                res.append(subset[:])
                return

            # CHOICE 1: Include current element
            subset.append(nums[i])
            backtrack(i + 1, subset)
            subset.pop()

            # CHOICE 2: Skip current & ALL duplicates
            while i + 1 < len(nums) and nums[i] == nums[i + 1]:
                i += 1  # Jump over all duplicates
            backtrack(i + 1, subset)

        backtrack(0, [])
        return res
```
