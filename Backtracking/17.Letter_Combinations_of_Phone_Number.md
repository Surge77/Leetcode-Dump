# ðŸ”¹ Problem Name: Letter Combinations of a Phone Number (Backtracking, Medium)

**ðŸ”— Link:** [LeetCode 17 - Letter Combinations of a Phone Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number/)
**ðŸŸ¢ Status:** âœ… Solved

## ðŸ”¹Quick Breakdown

* **Difficulty Level:** Medium
* **Main Approach:** Backtracking (Recursive DFS)
* **Core Concept:** Recursion, Combinatorial Generation, Mapping
* **When to Use This Pattern?** When you need to generate all possible combinations by picking one option from each group (cartesian product), and the number of groups is variable or dynamic (length of input).
* **Mistakes to Avoid:**
  * Incorrect digit-to-letter mapping (e.g., typos in the mapping, as seen with '7')
  * Not handling empty input (should return [])
  * Returning [""] instead of [] for empty input
  * Modifying the same string in-place (can cause state bugs, though in Python strings are immutable)

## ðŸ”¹ Optimization Path

* **Brute Force:** Enumerate all possible combinations manually (impractical for dynamic input)
* **Optimized Solution:** Use Backtracking/DFS to generate all valid combinations efficiently (O(3^N \* 4^M) where N=#digits mapped to 3 letters, M=#digits mapped to 4 letters)
* **Further Improvements Possible?** No further optimization for output size; the algorithm is output-bound. For practical code, can use iteration (queue) instead of recursion, but complexity stays the same.

## ðŸ”¹ Solution Breakdown

* **Optimal Approach:** Use backtracking to recursively build combinations by taking one letter from each digit, proceeding left-to-right.
* **Why This Works?** Recursively explores every path, adding one character from each digit at each recursion level; when a full-length string is built, it is a valid combination.
* **Edge Cases Considered:**
  * Empty string input â†’ return []
  * Digits not between '2'-'9' should never occur (by problem statement)
  * Correct order of letters (not required by problem)

## ðŸ”¹ Pattern Recognition

* **Belongs To:** Backtracking, Cartesian Product, Combinatorial Generation
* **Common Problems Using This:**
  * Generate Parentheses
  * Subsets, Permutations
  * Word Break (with Trie/Dictionary)
  * Combination Sum

## ðŸ”¹ Tricks & Patterns Used

* **Backtracking with Recursion**
* **String Building (not in-place)**
* **Immutable Strings**
* **Early Stopping (Base Case: len(curStr) == len(digits))**

## ðŸ”¹ Alternative Data Structures

* **Can this problem be optimized using a different DS?** Could use a queue (BFS/iteration) for level-wise building, but recursion is most natural and concise.
* **Example:** Iterative BFS with a queue to avoid recursion.

## ðŸ”¹ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(3^N \* 4^M)
  (Where N = digits mapping to 3 letters, M = digits mapping to 4 letters, total output size)
* **Space Complexity:** O(3^N \* 4^M) for output; recursion stack O(K) where K = number of digits.

## ðŸ”¹ Code Snippet (Optimized)

```python
class Solution:
    def letterCombinations(self, digits: str) -> List[str]:
        res = []
        digitToChar = {
            "2": "abc",
            "3": "def",
            "4": "ghi",
            "5": "jkl",
            "6": "mno",
            "7": "pqrs",   # Fixed mapping for '7'
            "8": "tuv",
            "9": "wxyz",
        }

        def backtrack(i, curStr):
            if len(curStr) == len(digits):
                res.append(curStr)
                return
            for c in digitToChar[digits[i]]:
                backtrack(i + 1, curStr + c)

        if digits:
            backtrack(0, "")

        return res
# Time: O(3^N * 4^M) | Space: O(3^N * 4^M)
```
