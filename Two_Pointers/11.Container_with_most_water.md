### ðŸ”¹ Problem Name: Container With Most Water (Two Pointers, Medium)

**ðŸ”— Link:** [LeetCode 11 - Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/description/)

**ðŸŸ¢ Status:** âœ… Solved

---

## ðŸ”¹Quick Breakdown

* **Difficulty Level:** Medium
* **Main Approach:** Two-pointer strategy to evaluate container area efficiently
* **Core Concept:** Greedy with two pointers
* **When to Use This Pattern?** When choosing the best pair from opposite ends with a shrinking window
* **Mistakes to Avoid:**
  * Using a nested loop (O(nÂ²))
  * Not moving the correct pointer (shorter line)

---

## ðŸ”¹ Optimization Path

* **Brute Force:** O(nÂ²) â€” Check all pairs of lines
* **Optimized Solution:** O(n) â€” Use two pointers and move inward strategically
* **Further Improvements Possible?** Not really, this is the optimal time complexity for this problem

---

## ðŸ”¹ Solution Breakdown

* **Optimal Approach:** Use two pointers starting at both ends, always move the pointer pointing to the shorter line
* **Why This Works?**
  * The area is limited by the **shorter** line, so to increase area, we must hope for a **taller** line by moving the shorter one inward
* **Edge Cases Considered:**
  * All heights are equal
  * One very tall bar and others short
  * Decreasing or increasing height sequence

---

## ðŸ”¹ Pattern Recognition

* **Belongs To:** Two Pointers
* **Common Problems Using This:**
  * Trapping Rain Water
  * 3Sum Closest
  * Minimum Size Subarray Sum (with Sliding Window variation)

---

## ðŸ”¹ Tricks & Patterns Used

* **Two Pointers (Opposite-End) Strategy**
* Greedy move: always eliminate the shorter bar
* Area calculation: `width * min(height[left], height[right])`

---

## ðŸ”¹ Alternative Data Structures

* **Can this problem be optimized using a different DS?**
  * Not really â€” the linear two-pointer approach is most efficient
* **Example:** No data structure improves beyond O(n)

---

## ðŸ”¹ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(n)
* **Space Complexity:** O(1)

## ðŸ”¹ Code Snippet (Optimized)

```python

class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        l, r = 0, len(height) - 1

        while l < r:
            area = (r - l) * min(height[r], height[l])
            res = max(res, area)

            if height[l] < height[r]:
                l += 1
            else:
                r -= 1

        return res

```
