# 🔹 Problem Name: Count and Say (Recursion, Medium)

**🔗 Link:**[LeetCode - Count and Say](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-04-18)

**🟢 Status:** ✅ Solved

---

## 🔹Quick Breakdown

* **Difficulty Level:** Medium
* **Main Approach:** Recursion with pattern parsing
* **Core Concept:** Recursion, String Manipulation
* **When to Use This Pattern?** When the current state is built by describing the previous one in terms of patterns
* **Mistakes to Avoid:**
  * Forgetting to reset `count` correctly
  * Misplacing index increment inside the `while` loop
  * Returning the wrong base case

---

## 🔹 Optimization Path

* **Brute Force:** Not applicable (problem is inherently recursive)
* **Optimized Solution:** Tailored recursion with StringBuilder
* **Further Improvements Possible?** Yes – can be converted to **iterative** solution for better control on stack usage

---

## 🔹 Solution Breakdown

* **Optimal Approach:** Use recursion to compute `countAndSay(n - 1)`, then traverse its result and build a string by counting consecutive repeating digits.
* **Why This Works?** Because each term in the sequence is built by *saying* the previous term — recursively breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems is both natural and efficient.
* **Edge Cases Considered:**
  * `n = 1` (base case)
  * Input lengths with many repeating digits like `"11112222"`
  * Consecutive single digits

---

## 🔹 Pattern Recognition

* **Belongs To:** Recursion, Pattern Expansion
* **Common Problems Using This:**
  * Decode Ways
  * String Compression
  * Look-and-say variants
  * Run-length Encoding

---

## 🔹 Tricks & Patterns Used

* **StringBuilder** for efficient string concatenation
* **Recursive Construction** of sequences
* **Pattern Parsing** using while-loops inside for-loops

---

## 🔹 Alternative Data Structures

* **Can this problem be optimized using a different DS?**
  * Yes. Using **StringBuffer** (Java) or **StringBuilder** speeds up string operations.
* **Example:** Using plain string concatenation would lead to O(n²) due to repeated copying.

---

## 🔹 Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(2ⁿ) approx. (since the length of the string almost doubles with each term)
* **Space Complexity:** O(2ⁿ) for recursive stack and string storage

---

## 🔹 Code Snippet (Optimized)

```java

class Solution {
    public String countAndSay(int n) {
        if (n == 1) return "1";

        String say = countAndSay(n - 1);
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();

        for (int i = 0; i < say.length(); i++) {
            int count = 1;
            char ch = say.charAt(i);

            while (i < say.length() - 1 && say.charAt(i) == say.charAt(i + 1)) {
                count++;
                i++;
            }

            result.append(count).append(ch);
        }

        return result.toString();
    }
}

```
