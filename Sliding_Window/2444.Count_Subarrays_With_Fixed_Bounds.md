# ðŸ”¹ Problem Name: Count Subarrays With Fixed Bounds (Sliding Window, Medium)

**ðŸ”— Link:**[ **Count Subarrays With Fixed Bounds**](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-subarrays-with-fixed-bounds)

**ðŸŸ¢ Status:** âœ… Solved

---

## ðŸ”¹Quick Breakdown

* **Difficulty Level:** Medium
* **Main Approach:** Sliding Window with Smart Index Tracking
* **Core Concept:** Window bounds, element validation
* **When to Use This Pattern?** When you're dealing with **fixed min/max conditions** in subarrays and want O(n) time.
* **Mistakes to Avoid:**
  * Not resetting the window when invalid elements are found.
  * Incorrectly counting subarrays that don't contain both minK and maxK.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Optimization Path

* **Brute Force:** O(nÂ²) â€” check all subarrays
* **Optimized Solution:** O(n) â€” sliding window with tracking min/max/corruption
* **Further Improvements Possible?** Pretty optimal. Minor tweaks for readability maybe.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Solution Breakdown

* **Optimal Approach:**
  Use a sliding window where we track the last seen positions of `minK`, `maxK`, and any invalid number (the "culprit"). For every position `i`, the number of valid subarrays ending at `i` is `min(minPosition, maxPosition) - culpritIdx`, if positive.
* **Why This Works?**
  The *last valid window* is limited by the most recent invalid number. Any subarray must include both `minK` and `maxK` and be fully within the valid bounds â€” so we count only if both were seen after the last invalid.
* **Edge Cases Considered:**
  * No minK or maxK seen yet â†’ count = 0
  * Invalid number at start â†’ ensures nothing before it is considered
  * Repeated minK/maxK â†’ updates their positions dynamically

---

## ðŸ”¹ Pattern Recognition

* **Belongs To:** Sliding Window
* **Common Problems Using This:**
  * Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K
  * Number of Subarrays With Bounded Maximum
  * Subarrays with K Different Integers

---

## ðŸ”¹ Tricks & Patterns Used

* **Index tracking** instead of maintaining an actual subarray
* **Math.min() - culprit** to count clean subarray zones
* No need to literally *slide* the window; the indices handle it

---

## ðŸ”¹ Alternative Data Structures

* **Can this problem be optimized using a different DS?**
  Not really â€” sliding window + index tracking is the most efficient.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(n)
* **Space Complexity:** O(1)

## ðŸ”¹ Code Snippet (Optimized)

```java

// âœ… FPT-Driven Sliding Window Solution
// T.C: O(n) | S.C: O(1)

class Solution {
    public long countSubarrays(int[] nums, int minK, int maxK) {

        long ans = 0;

        // Tracks the latest positions of critical elements
        int minPosition = -1;     // last seen index of minK
        int maxPosition = -1;     // last seen index of maxK
        int culpritIdx = -1;      // last seen index of invalid element

        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i){

            // If current number is out of bounds, it corrupts the window
            if(nums[i] < minK || nums[i] > maxK){
                culpritIdx = i;
            }

            // Track the last position where minK appeared
            if(nums[i] == minK){
                minPosition = i;
            }

            // Track the last position where maxK appeared
            if(nums[i] == maxK){
                maxPosition = i;
            }

            // Count valid subarrays ending at index i
            long count = Math.min(minPosition, maxPosition) - culpritIdx;

            // Only count if both minK and maxK were found after last invalid
            if(count > 0){
                ans += count;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
