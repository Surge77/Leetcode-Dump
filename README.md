### **How I Use This Repository** 🛠️📖🚀

1. **Practice problems:** I use this repository as a log of problems I’ve solved.
2. **Review patterns:** Revisiting solutions helps me quickly identify and recall patterns.
3. **Iterative improvement:** I update solutions as I discover better or more efficient approaches.
4. **Run code locally:** Each solution is standalone and can be executed directly for testing.

### **Best Practices I Follow** 🧠✔️🔧

* Documenting **time & space complexity** for every solution.
* Writing **readable, clean code** with intuitive variable names.
* Showing **multiple approaches** for comparison.
* Including **detailed reasoning** for tricky or less obvious solutions.

---

### **Personal Roadmap** 🗺️🚧📈

* Expand coverage to include **hard-level problems**.
* Add **flowcharts or step-by-step breakdowns** for complex problems.
* Create **pattern-based solution sets** (e.g., sliding window problems grouped together).
* Maintain **regular updates** as I practice new problems.
