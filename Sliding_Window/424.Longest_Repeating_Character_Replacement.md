# ðŸ”¹ Problem Name: **Longest Repeating Character Replacement** (Sliding Window, Medium)

**ðŸ”— Link:**[Leetcode 424](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement/description/)

**ðŸŸ¢ Status:** âœ… Solved

---

## ðŸ”¹Quick Breakdown

* **Difficulty Level:** Medium
* **Main Approach:** Sliding Window with Character Frequency
* **Core Concept:** Max frequency character in window determines how many changes we need
* **When to Use This Pattern?** When asked to find the longest substring with at most `k` changes to make it uniform
* **Mistakes to Avoid:**
  * Recalculating `maxf` on shrink (you can keep it stale)
  * Forgetting to check `window size - maxf > k`

---

## ðŸ”¹ Optimization Path

* **Brute Force:** O(nÂ²) â†’ Try every substring and check if it can be converted with â‰¤k changes
* **Optimized Solution:** O(n) using sliding window and character count
* **Further Improvements Possible?** Minor improvements like using an array instead of dict for speed (if needed)

---

## ðŸ”¹ Solution Breakdown

* **Optimal Approach:** Use sliding window. Track character frequencies. Shrink window when more than `k` replacements needed.
* **Why This Works?** Because changing all but the most frequent character in the window is optimal
* **Edge Cases Considered:**
  * Empty string
  * k = 0
  * All characters same

---

## ðŸ”¹ Pattern Recognition

* **Belongs To:** Sliding Window
* **Common Problems Using This:**
  * Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters
  * Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
  * Replace Ones to Get Longest Ones Subarray

---

## ðŸ”¹ Tricks & Patterns Used

* **Sliding window expansion + shrinking**
* **Max frequency tracking**
* **Window size formula: `r - l + 1`**
* Allowing `maxf` to be slightly stale (not updated when shrinking)

---

## ðŸ”¹ Alternative Data Structures

* **Can this problem be optimized using a different DS?**
  * Yes, a **fixed-size array (size 26)** instead of dict improves perf slightly
* **Example:**
  ```python

  count = [0] * 26
  ```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(n)
* **Space Complexity:** O(26) = O(1), because only uppercase letters

## ðŸ”¹ Code Snippet (Optimized)

```python

class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        count = {}
        res = 0
        l = 0
        maxf = 0

        for r in range(len(s)):
            count[s[r]] = 1 + count.get(s[r], 0)
            maxf = max(maxf, count[s[r]])

            # If the number of characters to change > k, shrink window
            while (r - l + 1) - maxf > k:
                count[s[l]] -= 1
                l += 1

            # Always track the max valid window
            res = max(res, r - l + 1)

        return res
```
