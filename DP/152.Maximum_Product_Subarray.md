# ðŸ”¹ Problem Name: Maximum Product Subarray (Dynamic Programming, Medium)

**ðŸ”— Link:** [LeetCode - Maximum Product Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/description/)

**ðŸŸ¢ Status:** âœ… Solved

---

## ðŸ”¹Quick Breakdown

* **Difficulty Level:** Medium
* **Main Approach:** Extend Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm to track max & min product subarrays
* **Core Concept:** Dynamic Programming
* **When to Use This Pattern?**
  When dealing with **products of subarrays**, especially where **negatives or zeros** can flip or reset the product unexpectedly.
* **Mistakes to Avoid:**
  * Not tracking both max & min
  * Not handling zero properly
  * Initializing with 1 (instead of nums[0]) in some places can lead to wrong answers

---

## ðŸ”¹ Optimization Path

* **Brute Force:** O(nÂ²) â€” Try all subarrays and compute product
* **Optimized Solution:** O(n) â€” Track curMin and curMax dynamically
* **Further Improvements Possible?**
  No, this is already optimal for time and space.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Solution Breakdown

* **Optimal Approach:** Dynamic tracking of maximum and minimum products ending at each position
* **Why This Works?**
  Negative numbers can flip the product, so we need to track both the best and worst product so far â€” any one of them might become the best in future.
* **Edge Cases Considered:**
  * All negative numbers
  * Single element array
  * Zeros (force reset)

## ðŸ”¹ Pattern Recognition

* **Belongs To:**
  ðŸ”¸ Dynamic Programming (modified Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm)
* **Common Problems Using This:**
  * Maximum Subarray Sum (classic Kadane)
  * Min/Max subarray product/sum
  * Subarray with product less than k

---

## ðŸ”¹ Tricks & Patterns Used

* **Dynamic Programming Recurrence**
  * Maintain both min and max to handle negative flips
* **Reset on zero implicitly handled by `num` itself**

---

## ðŸ”¹ Alternative Data Structures

* No advanced data structures needed. This is a pure DP/greedy hybrid.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(n) â€” One pass through the array
* **Space Complexity:** O(1) â€” Only constant variables used

## ðŸ”¹ Code Snippet (Optimized with Comments)

```python

class Solution:
    def maxProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Initialize result as the first element of the array
        res = nums[0]

        # curMax: max product ending at current index
        # curMin: min product ending at current index (important for negatives)
        curMin, curMax = 1, 1

        for num in nums:
            # temp stores current max * num, because we overwrite curMax
            tmp = curMax * num

            # Calculate new curMax and curMin considering:
            # 1. current number
            # 2. current number * previous curMax
            # 3. current number * previous curMin
            curMax = max(num * curMax, num * curMin, num)
            curMin = min(tmp, num * curMin, num)

            # Update the global result
            res = max(res, curMax)

        return res

```
