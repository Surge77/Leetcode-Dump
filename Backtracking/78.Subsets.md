# ğŸ”¹ Problem Name: Subsets (Backtracking, Medium)

**ğŸ”— Link:** [Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/)
**ğŸŸ¢ Status:** âœ… Solved

## ğŸ”¹ Quick Breakdown

* **Difficulty Level:** Medium
* **Main Approach:** Use **backtracking** to explore all possible subsets by making inclusion/exclusion decisions for each element.
* **Core Concept:** Recursion + Backtracking + Power Set generation.
* **When to Use This Pattern?** Whenever you're asked to generate all combinations, subsets, or power sets of a given set/array.
* **Mistakes to Avoid:**
  * Forgetting to copy the current subset (using `.copy()`) before appending to `res`.
  * Not handling the base case correctly when `i` exceeds the array length.
  * Confusing subsets with permutations (subsets don't care about order).

---

## ğŸ”¹ Optimization Path

* **Brute Force:** Generate all binary strings of length `n` and map 1/0 to include/exclude elements. **Time:** O(n \* 2^n). **Space:** O(n) recursion depth.
* **Optimized Solution:** Backtracking directly generates subsets without extra binary representation steps. **Time:** O(n \* 2^n). **Space:** O(n) (call stack).
* **Further Improvements Possible?** Not muchâ€”generating all subsets inherently requires O(2^n) time.

## ğŸ”¹ Solution Breakdown

* **Optimal Approach:** Use DFS with two decisions at each step: include or exclude `nums[i]`.
* **Why This Works?** The recursion tree naturally explores all possible combinations by branching at each index (include vs exclude).
* **Edge Cases Considered:**
  * Empty array `[]` (should return `[[]]`).
  * Single element array `[x]` (should return `[[], [x]]`).
  * Duplicates are not handled (but problem assumes distinct integers).

## ğŸ”¹ Pattern Recognition

* **Belongs To:** Backtracking pattern.
* **Common Problems Using This:**
  * Combinations (LeetCode 77)
  * Permutations (LeetCode 46)
  * Combination Sum (LeetCode 39)
  * Subsets II (LeetCode 90)

## ğŸ”¹ Tricks & Patterns Used

* **Choice Diagram:** Include current element or skip it.
* **Backtracking Template:** Add choice -> Recurse -> Undo choice.
* **Use of `.copy()`:** Prevents mutation issues.

## ğŸ”¹ Alternative Data Structures

* Could use **bitmasking** to generate subsets: For each integer 0 to 2^n - 1, use its binary form to decide inclusion/exclusion.
* Example: For `nums = [1,2,3]`, binary `101` represents subset `[1,3]`.

---

## ğŸ”¹ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(n \* 2^n), because each of the `2^n` subsets takes up to O(n) to build/copy.
* **Space Complexity:** O(n) (recursion depth + subset building).

## ğŸ”¹ Code Snippet (Optimized)

```python

class Solution:
    def subsets(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []
        subset = []
  
        def dfs(i: int):
            # Base case: we've considered all elements
            if i >= len(nums):
                res.append(subset.copy())  # Take a snapshot
                return
      
            # 1. Include nums[i]
            subset.append(nums[i])
            dfs(i + 1)
      
            # 2. Exclude nums[i] (backtrack)
            subset.pop()
            dfs(i + 1)
  
        dfs(0)
        return res
```
