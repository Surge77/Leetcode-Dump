# ðŸ”¹ Problem Name: Move Zeroes (Array, Two Pointers, Easy)

ðŸ”— Link: [283. Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)
**ðŸŸ¢ Status:** âœ… Solved

## **ðŸ”¹ Key Takeaways (1-Min Summary)**

* **Main Approach:** Use a **two-pointer technique** to move non-zero elements forward while replacing the remaining elements with zeroes.
* Core Concept:**Two Pointers + In-Place Modification**
* **When to Use This Pattern?**
  * When you need to **rearrange elements** in an array **in-place**.
  * When **relative order** of elements **must be preserved** while filtering out specific values (like zeroes).
* **Mistakes to Avoid:**
  * Forgetting to replace the remaining elements with zeroes after moving non-zero elements.
  * Using `nums[i] = nums[j]` without ensuring the previous `nums[j]` is already moved.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Solution Breakdown**

* **Optimal Approach:**
  * Use a pointer (`insertPosition`) to track the index where the next non-zero element should be placed.
  * Iterate through `nums`, moving non-zero elements forward.
  * After all non-zero elements are placed, **fill the remaining indices with zeroes**.
* **Why This Works?**
  * Ensures that non-zero elements **maintain their order** while pushing zeroes to the end **in O(n) time**.
* **Edge Cases Considered:**
  * Already sorted (e.g., `[1,2,3,0,0]`).
  * All zeroes (e.g., `[0,0,0,0]`).
  * No zeroes (e.g., `[1,2,3]`).
  * Single-element cases (`[0]`, `[1]`).

## **ðŸ”¹ Pattern Recognition**

* Belongs To:**Two Pointers, In-Place Rearrangement**
* **Common Problems Using This:**
  * **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array (LC #26)**
  * **Sort Array by Parity (LC #905)**
  * **Move Elements in Array (LC #1089, LC #977)**

## **ðŸ”¹ Complexity Analysis**

* **Time Complexity:** O(n) â†’ Single pass through `nums`.
* **Space Complexity:** O(1) â†’ In-place modification.

## **ðŸ”¹ Code Snippet (Optimized)**

```java
class Solution {
    public void moveZeroes(int[] nums) {

        //We start from the first position
        int insertPosition = 0;

        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
            //inserting non zero elements at the start of array

            if(nums[i] != 0){
                nums[insertPosition] = nums[i];
                insertPosition++;
            }
        }

        //Filling the remaining array with the zeroes
        //the insertPosition would be pointing to the last non zero element in the array
        //Even after the insertPosition there would be non zero elements but those elements have already been added to the start of the array 
        //So we change them to zeroes

        while(insertPosition < nums.length){
            nums[insertPosition] = 0;
            insertPosition++;
        } 
  
    }
}
```
