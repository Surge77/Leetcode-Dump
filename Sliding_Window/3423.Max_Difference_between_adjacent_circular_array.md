# ðŸ”¹ Problem Name: Maximum Difference Between Adjacent Elements in a Circular Array (Array, Easy)

**ðŸ”— Link:** [LeetCode 3423](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-difference-between-adjacent-elements-in-a-circular-array/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-06-12)

## ðŸ”¹Quick Breakdown

* **Difficulty Level:** Easy
* **Main Approach:** One-pass linear scan
* **Core Concept:** Compare adjacent differences, including the circular edge (last â†’ first)
* **When to Use This Pattern?**
  * You're given a circular array and asked for max/min difference between **adjacent** elements.
  * The words "wrap around" or "circular" should set off alarms.
* **Mistakes to Avoid:**
  * Ignoring the last-to-first element difference (circular case)
  * Overcomplicating with extra space or unnecessary checks

---

## ðŸ”¹ Optimization Path

* **Brute Force:**
  * Compare every pair (could lead to O(nÂ²) if misunderstood)
* **Optimized Solution:**
  * Single pass with `abs()` checks for adjacent elements + the lastâ†’first wrap â†’ `O(n)`
* **Further Improvements Possible?**
  * Already optimal â€“ `O(n)` with `O(1)` space

---

## ðŸ”¹ Solution Breakdown

* **Optimal Approach:**
  * Loop from index 1 to n-1, compute `abs(nums[i] - nums[i-1])`
  * Additionally compute `abs(nums[-1] - nums[0])` (circular diff)
  * Track the maximum of all
* **Why This Works?**
  * You compare all pairs of neighbors once
  * The wrap-around is handled separately
  * No sorting or extra data structure needed
* **Edge Cases Considered:**
  * Only 2 elements â†’ just return `abs(nums[0] - nums[1])`
  * All elements same â†’ return 0

## ðŸ”¹ Pattern Recognition

* **Belongs To:**
  * ðŸ”¹ **Sliding Window** (size 2)
  * ðŸ”¹ **Two-Pointer / Adjacent Difference**
  * ðŸ”¹ **Circular Array Processing**

---

## ðŸ”¹ Tricks & Patterns Used

* `abs(a - b)` to avoid negative differences
* `max(...)` one-liner or rolling update
* Circular wrap-around with `nums[-1] - nums[0]`

---

## ðŸ”¹ Alternative Data Structures

* Not needed
* In a stream or dynamic update scenario, we could use a deque or segment tree, but here itâ€™s simple

---

## ðŸ”¹ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:**`O(n)`
  * Single pass through the array
* **Space Complexity:**`O(1)`
  * No extra space used

## ðŸ”¹ Code Snippet (Optimized)

```python

class Solution:
    def maxDiff(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        max_diff = abs(nums[0] - nums[-1])  # circular pair
        for i in range(1, n):
            max_diff = max(max_diff, abs(nums[i] - nums[i - 1]))
        return max_diff

```
