# ðŸ”¹ Problem Name: Minimum Sum to Equal Two Arrays (Greedy, Medium)

ðŸ”— Link: [2918. Minimum Equal Sum of Two Arrays After Replacing Zeros](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-equal-sum-of-two-arrays-after-replacing-zeros/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-05-10)

**ðŸŸ¢ Status:** âœ… Solved

## ðŸ”¹Quick Breakdown

* **Difficulty Level:** Medium
* **Main Approach:** Greedily replace `0`s with `1` (smallest possible value)
* **Core Concept:** Greedy Algorithm
* **When to Use This Pattern?**
  * When a decision can be made at each step with a local optimum (like replacing zero with minimum non-zero)
  * When youâ€™re allowed to tweak or simulate values to minimize or balance two totals
* **Mistakes to Avoid:**
  * Forgetting to simulate zero as +1
  * Ignoring edge case when **no zeros are present** but the sums are unequal

---

## ðŸ”¹ Optimization Path

* **Brute Force:** Try all combinations of values replacing zeros â†’ exponential time (not feasible)
* **Optimized Solution:** Greedy simulation â†’ **O(m + n)**
* **Further Improvements Possible?** Not really; this is optimal in terms of time and space for the given constraints

---

## ðŸ”¹ Solution Breakdown

* **Optimal Approach:**
  * Traverse both arrays
  * Sum elements, and for each zero, simulate replacing it with a `1`
  * After processing, compare the two sums â€” if the smaller one has no zeros, and is still smaller, return `1`
  * Else, return the larger sum
* **Why This Works?**
  * The greedy choice (replace each 0 with `1`) ensures we're adding the **least possible value** to balance the sum
  * If even with 1s the sums can't be equalized, no other positive integers can help
* **Edge Cases Considered:**
  * No zeros at all
  * Arrays of different sizes
  * Already equal sums
  * All elements are zeros

## ðŸ”¹ Pattern Recognition

* **Belongs To:** Greedy Algorithms
* **Common Problems Using This:**
  * Leetcode 135: Candy
  * Leetcode 1029: Two City Scheduling
  * Leetcode 406: Queue Reconstruction by Height

## ðŸ”¹ Tricks & Patterns Used

* **Greedy Simulation**
* **Conditional Sum Adjustment**
* **Basic Array Traversal**

## ðŸ”¹ Alternative Data Structures

* **Can this problem be optimized using a different DS?** Not really applicable here â€” it's a greedy logic problem
* **Example:** You might use `Streams` in Java for cleaner summing but not necessary for logic

---

## ðŸ”¹ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(m + n) â€” one pass through each array
* **Space Complexity:** O(1) â€” constant extra space

## ðŸ”¹ Code Snippet (Optimized)

```java

class Solution {
    public long minSum(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        long sum1 = 0, sum2 = 0;
        long zero1 = 0, zero2 = 0;

        for (int num : nums1) {
            sum1 += num;
            if (num == 0) {
                zero1++;
                sum1 += 1; // simulate 0 as 1
            }
        }

        for (int num : nums2) {
            sum2 += num;
            if (num == 0) {
                zero2++;
                sum2 += 1; // simulate 0 as 1
            }
        }

        if ((sum1 < sum2 && zero1 == 0) || (sum2 < sum1 && zero2 == 0)) {
            return -1;
        }

        return Math.max(sum1, sum2);
    }
}
