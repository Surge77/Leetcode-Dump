# 🔹 Problem Name: Single Number (Bit Manipulation, Easy)

**🔗 Link:** [LeetCode 136 - Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)
**🟢 Status:** ✅ Solved

---

## 🔹 Quick Breakdown

* **Difficulty Level:** Easy
* **Main Approach:** XOR all elements — duplicates cancel out, leaving the unique number.
* **Core Concept:** **Bit Manipulation / XOR property**.
* **When to Use This Pattern?** When every element appears exactly twice except one.
* **Mistakes to Avoid:**

  * Using extra structures like sets or maps (wastes space).
  * Thinking XOR depends on order (it doesn’t).
  * Forgetting XOR identity (`0 ^ x = x`).

---

## 🔹 Optimization Path

* **Naive:** Nested loops checking counts, O(n^2).
* **Better:** Use HashSet or dictionary, O(n) time, O(n) space.
* **Optimized Solution (This):** XOR trick, O(n) time, O(1) space.
* **Further Improvements Possible?** Not needed; this is already optimal.

---

## 🔹 Solution Breakdown

* **Optimal Approach:** XOR all numbers. Since `a ^ a = 0` and XOR is commutative and associative, pairs cancel out, leaving only the unique element.
* **Why This Works?** Duplicate numbers vanish through XOR cancellation, leaving the unpaired number.
* **Edge Cases Considered:**

  * Single-element array.
  * Large values of integers.
  * Negative numbers (XOR works regardless).

## 🔹 Pattern Recognition

* **Belongs To:** Bit Manipulation (XOR Tricks).
* **Common Problems Using This:**

  * [137. Single Number II](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/)
  * [260. Single Number III](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii/)
  * [268. Missing Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/)
  * [389. Find the Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/)

## 🔹 Tricks & Patterns Used

* **XOR cancellation** → pairs reduce to zero.
* **XOR identity element (0)** → safe initialization.
* **Commutativity & associativity** → order doesn’t matter.

---

## 🔹 Alternative Data Structures

* **HashSet / Counter:** Works but uses extra O(n) space.
* **Sorting:** Identify single number by comparing neighbors, O(n log n).

---

## 🔹 Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(n).
* **Space Complexity:** O(1).

## 🔹 Code Snippet (Optimized)

```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        for num in nums:
            res ^= num
        return res

# ⏱ Time: O(n)
# 💾 Space: O(1)
```

✅ **Final Takeaway:** XOR is the **cleanest and most efficient** tool to isolate the unique number — minimal code, no extra space, and lightning-fast.
