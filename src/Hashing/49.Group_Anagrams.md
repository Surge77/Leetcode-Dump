# ðŸ”¹ Problem Name: Group Anagrams (String, Medium)

**ðŸ”— Link:** [Leetcode - Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/description/)

**ðŸŸ¢ Status:** âœ… Solved / ðŸ”„ Need Review

## ðŸ”¹Quick Breakdown

- **Difficulty Level:** Medium
- **Main Approach:** Sorting the characters of each string and using the sorted string as the key to group anagrams.
- **Core Concept:** HashMap, Sorting
- **When to Use This Pattern?** When you need to group words or characters that have a similar structure (like anagrams) and can be normalized by sorting or another transformation.
- **Mistakes to Avoid:**
  - Forgetting to sort the characters of each string before using it as a key.
  - Not checking if the sorted word exists in the map before adding the word.

## ðŸ”¹ Optimization Path

- **Brute Force:** O(k * n^2) - Compare every word with every other word for anagram checks.
- **Optimized Solution:** O(k * n log n) - Sort each word and group them by their sorted key in a map.
- **Further Improvements Possible?** This is an optimal solution for this problem; there isn't much room for further optimization without changing the core approach.

## ðŸ”¹ Solution Breakdown

- **Optimal Approach:**
  - Sort each word, use the sorted word as the key, and group words with the same sorted characters.
    For smaller datasets or when `n` is small, **sorting** is a simple and effective approach. For larger datasets, especially when word lengths (`n`) increase, **frequency counting** will likely perform better in terms of time complexity.
- **Why This Works?** Sorting normalizes all anagrams to the same string, making it easy to group them in a HashMap.
- **Edge Cases Considered:**
  - Empty input array (`strs == null || strs.length == 0`).
  - Single word.
  - Words with different characters but same length.

## ðŸ”¹ Pattern Recognition

- **Belongs To:** HashMap, Sorting
- **Common Problems Using This:**
  - Grouping words by some transformation.
  - Detecting anagrams.
  - Classifying strings based on normalized characteristics.

## ðŸ”¹ Tricks & Patterns Used

- **Sorting** - Sorting the characters in each word to normalize anagrams.
- **HashMap** - Using the sorted word as the key in the map and grouping words under that key.

## ðŸ”¹ Alternative Data Structures

- **Can this problem be optimized using a different DS?** A Trie could also work, where words are inserted character by character, but sorting provides a simpler and more efficient solution.
- **Example:** Using a **Trie** to group anagrams.

## ðŸ”¹ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(k * n log n)
  - `k` is the number of words, and `n` is the average length of the strings. Sorting each string takes O(n log n) time.
- **Space Complexity:** O(k * n)
  - We store all the words in the map, and each word has a length of `n`. The space complexity is proportional to the number of words and their lengths.

## ðŸ”¹ Code Snippet (Optimized)

```java

class Solution {
    public List<List<String>> groupAnagrams(String[] strs) {
        Map<String, List<String>> map = new HashMap<>();

        for (String word : strs) {
            char[] chars = word.toCharArray();
            Arrays.sort(chars);  // Sort the word's characters.
            String sortedWord = new String(chars);  // Convert the sorted character array back to a string.

            if (!map.containsKey(sortedWord)) {
                map.put(sortedWord, new ArrayList<>());
            }

            map.get(sortedWord).add(word);  // Add the original word to the group of anagrams.
        }

        return new ArrayList<>(map.values());  // Return the grouped anagrams.
    }
}

```
