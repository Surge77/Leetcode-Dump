# ðŸ”¹ Problem Name: Ransom Note (Hash Map / Frequency Count, Easy)

**ðŸ”— Link:** [LeetCode 383 â€“ Ransom Note](https://leetcode.com/problems/ransom-note/description/)

**ðŸŸ¢ Status:** âœ… Solved

---

## ðŸ”¹Quick Breakdown

* **Difficulty Level:** Easy
* **Main Approach:** Build frequency count of `magazine`, then check if all characters in `ransomNote` can be fulfilled.
* **Core Concept:** Hash Map (Character Frequency Count)
* **When to Use This Pattern?**
  * When you're asked "can X be formed from Y?"
  * When you need to match character counts or availability of items
* **Mistakes to Avoid:**
  * Not accounting for character multiplicity (i.e., `'aab'` â‰  `'ab'`)
  * Forgetting to fail early when a letter is missing
  * Confusing order of characters with frequency (order doesn't matter here)

---

## ðŸ”¹ Optimization Path

* **Brute Force:**
  * For each char in `ransomNote`, search and remove from `magazine` â†’ **O(n Ã— m)**
* **Optimized Solution:**
  * Use a hash map to count letters in `magazine`, then subtract while scanning `ransomNote` â†’ **O(m + n)**
* **Further Improvements Possible?**
  * Yes: Replace dict with a **fixed-size array (length 26)** for constant-time char access, better performance.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Solution Breakdown

* **Optimal Approach:**
  * Count how many times each letter appears in `magazine`.
  * For each character in `ransomNote`, check if it exists in the map with positive count.
  * If not, return `False`. Else, consume one occurrence.
* **Why This Works?**
  * Because we're modeling the problem as a **multiset containment check** â€” does `magazine` supply all the letter *counts* needed for `ransomNote`?
* **Edge Cases Considered:**
  * Empty `ransomNote` â†’ `True`
  * Empty `magazine` â†’ `False` if `ransomNote` is non-empty
  * Extra characters in `magazine` donâ€™t hurt
  * Characters in any order

## ðŸ”¹ Pattern Recognition

* **Belongs To:**
  âœ… **Prefix Sum / Frequency Count / Hash Map Counting**
  âœ… Can also be viewed under **Multiset Matching**
* **Common Problems Using This:**
  * Valid Anagram
  * Jewels and Stones
  * Group Anagrams
  * Find the Difference

## ðŸ”¹ Tricks & Patterns Used

* **Hash Map for Frequency Count**
* **Fail-Fast Strategy:** early exit when count is insufficient
* **Increment with `.get(c, 0)` idiom**
* **Decrement as you go** to simulate "consuming" letters

## ðŸ”¹ Alternative Data Structures

* **Can this problem be optimized using a different DS?**
  âœ… Yes, a fixed-size **int[26]** array instead of a `dict` for lowercase letters
* **Example:**
  ```python

  counts = [0]*26
  for c in magazine:
      counts[ord(c)-ord('a')] += 1
  for c in ransomNote:
      idx = ord(c)-ord('a')
      counts[idx] -= 1
      if counts[idx] < 0:
          return False
  return True

  ```

## ðŸ”¹ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:**
  âœ… O(m + n)
  Where:
  * m = length of `magazine`
  * n = length of `ransomNote`
* **Space Complexity:**
  âœ… O(1) â€” Since only 26 lowercase letters are used â†’ constant space
  (Technically O(Ïƒ), where Ïƒ = character set size)

## ðŸ”¹ Code Snippet (Optimized)

```python

class Solution:
    def canConstruct(self, ransomNote: str, magazine: str) -> bool:
        # â‘  Build frequency map for magazine  ----  O(m)
        maga_hash = {}
        for c in magazine:
            maga_hash[c] = 1 + maga_hash.get(c, 0)

        # â‘¡ Consume letters for ransomNote ----  O(n)
        for c in ransomNote:
            # Missing letter or exhausted supply? fail fast
            if c not in maga_hash or maga_hash[c] <= 0:
                return False
            maga_hash[c] -= 1  # use one copy

        # â‘¢ All letters satisfied
        return True

# Time Complexity: O(m + n)
# Space Complexity: O(1)  # 26-letter alphabet

```
