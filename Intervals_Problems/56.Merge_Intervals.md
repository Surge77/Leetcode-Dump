# ðŸ”¹ Problem Name: Merge Intervals (Array, Sorting, Greedy â€“ Medium)

**ðŸ”— Link:** [LeetCode 56 â€“ Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/description/)

**ðŸŸ¢ Status:** âœ… Solved

## ðŸ”¹Quick Breakdown

* **Difficulty Level:** Medium
* **Main Approach:** Sort intervals, then iterate and merge overlapping intervals in one pass
* **Core Concept:** Greedy (always merge as much as possible when intervals overlap)
* **When to Use This Pattern?**
  * When given a list of intervals/ranges and need to combine overlaps or cover ranges
* **Mistakes to Avoid:**
  * Not sorting first (can miss overlaps)
  * Only merging strictly overlapping, not touching intervals (e.g., `[1,4]` and `[4,5]` must merge)

## ðŸ”¹ Optimization Path

* **Brute Force:**
  * Compare every pair of intervals and merge if overlap; repeat until no more merges (O(n^2))
* **Optimized Solution:**
  * Sort by start, merge in one pass (O(n log n))
* **Further Improvements Possible?**
  * For massive inputs with constraints, may use sweep-line, but O(n log n) is optimal for typical interview constraints

## ðŸ”¹ Solution Breakdown

* **Optimal Approach:**
  * Sort intervals by start.
  * Traverse, merging intervals where current.start â‰¤ lastMerged.end.
  * If overlap, extend lastMerged.end; else, append current interval as new range.
* **Why This Works?**
  * Sorting guarantees all overlaps are adjacent, and greedy merge ensures minimal non-overlapping intervals.
* **Edge Cases Considered:**
  * Single interval
  * Touching intervals (end == start)
  * All intervals overlapping
  * No overlap at all

## ðŸ”¹ Pattern Recognition

* **Belongs To:** Interval Merge / Greedy
* **Common Problems Using This:**
  * Insert Interval
  * Meeting Rooms
  * Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons
  * Interval List Intersections
  * Employee Free Time

## ðŸ”¹ Tricks & Patterns Used

* **Sorting by start value**
* **Greedy extension of intervals**
* **Direct list access (output[-1][1]) for in-place merging**

## ðŸ”¹ Alternative Data Structures

* **Can this problem be optimized using a different DS?**
  * Usually, not needed. For extreme cases, may use heap/priority queue (rare for this exact problem).
* **Example:** Not typical for this problem; array is most natural.

## ðŸ”¹ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(n log n)
  * Sorting: O(n log n)
  * One pass merging: O(n)
* **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  * Output list in worst case (no overlaps)

## ðŸ”¹ Code Snippet (Optimized)

```python

class Solution:
    def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        # Time: O(n log n), Space: O(n)
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])  # Sort by start time
        output = [intervals[0]]
        for start, end in intervals[1:]:
            lastEnd = output[-1][1]
            if start <= lastEnd:  # Overlapping or touching
                output[-1][1] = max(lastEnd, end)  # Merge/expand interval
            else:
                output.append([start, end])  # No overlap, add new
        return output

```
