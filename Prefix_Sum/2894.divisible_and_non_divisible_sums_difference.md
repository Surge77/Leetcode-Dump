# ðŸ”¹Problem Name: Divisible and Non-divisible Sums Difference (Math, Easy)

**ðŸ”— Link:** [LeetCode 2894](https://leetcode.com/problems/divisible-and-non-divisible-sums-difference/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-05-27)

**ðŸŸ¢ Status:** âœ… Solved

## ðŸ”¹Quick Breakdown

* **Difficulty Level:** Easy
* **Main Approach:** Math in constant time
* **Core Concept:** Arithmetic Progression (AP) formulas
* **When to Use This Pattern?**
  When you need to separate a set of numbers into divisible vs non-divisible parts and compute their sums efficiently.
* **Mistakes to Avoid:**
  * Donâ€™t use loops unnecessarily.
  * Ensure you compute number of divisible terms correctly with `n / m`.

## ðŸ”¹ Optimization Path

* **Brute Force:** O(n) â€“ Loop through 1 to n, check divisible, add up both parts
* **Optimized Solution:** O(1) â€“ Direct formula application
* **Further Improvements Possible?** Already optimal

## ðŸ”¹ Solution Breakdown

* **Optimal Approach:**
  Compute total sum of numbers 1 to `n`.
  Calculate how many numbers from 1 to `n` are divisible by `m`.
  Use AP formula to calculate sum of those divisible numbers.
  Subtract that from total sum to get non-divisible sum.
  Return the difference.
* **Why This Works?**
  Arithmetic sequences can be summed in constant time.
  The trick is realizing that all divisible numbers are multiples of `m`, and we know how many there are (`k = n / m`).
* **Edge Cases Considered:**
  * When `m > n`, no divisible numbers â†’ entire range is non-divisible
  * When `m == 1`, everything is divisible â†’ non-divisible sum is zero

## ðŸ”¹ Pattern Recognition

* **Belongs To:** Math Tricks, Prefix Sum-esque Thinking
* **Common Problems Using This:**
  * Multiples of 3 and 5 (Project Euler-style)
  * Find sum of even vs odd numbers
  * Inclusion/Exclusion principle trick problems

## ðŸ”¹ Tricks & Patterns Used

* **Arithmetic Progression Formula**:
  * `Sum of 1..n = n(n+1)/2`
  * `Sum of first k multiples of m = m * k(k+1)/2`

## ðŸ”¹ Alternative Data Structures

* **Can this problem be optimized using a different DS?**
  Nope. No data structures needed at all.
* **Example:** No benefit from lists, maps, sets, etc.

## ðŸ”¹ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(1) â€“ Single shot math
* **Space Complexity:** O(1) â€“ No extra space

## ðŸ”¹ Code Snippet (Optimized, Java)

```java

// Approach - Constant time using maths
// T.C : O(1)
// S.C : O(1)

class Solution {
    public int differenceOfSums(int n, int m) {
        int k = n / m;

        // Using variables for clarity
        int totalSum = n * (n + 1) / 2;
        int divisibleSum = m * k * (k + 1) / 2;
        int nonDivisibleSum = totalSum - divisibleSum;

        return nonDivisibleSum - divisibleSum;
    }
}

```
