# ðŸ”¹ Problem Name: **Middle Element Check in Subarrays** (Array Traversal, Easy)

**ðŸ”— Link:**[Leetcode 3392](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-subarrays-of-length-three-with-a-condition/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-04-27)

**ðŸŸ¢ Status:** âœ… Solved

## ðŸ”¹ Quick Breakdown

* **Difficulty Level:** Easy
* **Main Approach:** Straight linear traversal, checking neighbors.
* **Core Concept:** Array Indexing and Arithmetic Conditions.
* **When to Use This Pattern?** When you need to check a middle element relative to its neighbors without creating extra subarrays.
* **Mistakes to Avoid:**
  * Accidentally multiplying the wrong side.
  * Out-of-bound errors at the edges (`i-1` or `i+1`).

---

## ðŸ”¹ Optimization Path

* **Brute Force:** O(n) (you have no real brute-force here, just a clean O(n) first pass)
* **Optimized Solution:** O(n) â€” no extra memory, no division.
* **Further Improvements Possible?** Nope, already optimal for single-pass neighbor checking.

## ðŸ”¹ Solution Breakdown (FPT Style)

**First Principles Thinking:**

* You don't **assume** fancy structures like prefix sums, sliding windows, or anything.
* **You go from scratch**:
  * Every element (except the first and last) has two neighbors.
  * Check: Is the middle value exactly the **average** of its left and right neighbors?
* But **division** is slow (expensive CPU-wise), so instead of: `nums[i] == (nums[i-1] + nums[i+1])/2` you smartly rearranged it to: `2 * nums[i] == nums[i-1] + nums[i+1]` to **avoid division**.

**Summary**: You stick to raw CPU-efficient operations â€” addition and multiplication only.

**No extra space. No libraries. Just brain + array.**

## ðŸ”¹ Pattern Recognition

* **Belongs To:** Simple Array Traversal / Neighbor Checking.
* **Common Problems Using This:**
  * Peak Element finding.
  * Bitonic Array Checks.
  * Local Maximums/Minimums problems.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Tricks & Patterns Used

* **Avoid Division Trick**: Instead of `a == (b+c)/2`, check `2a == b+c`.
* **Boundary Protection**: Start loop at index `1`, end at `n-2`, so neighbors exist.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Alternative Data Structures

* **Can this problem be optimized using a different DS?**
  No. Arrays are perfect here. Anything else would overcomplicate.
* **Example:** A Deque or Sliding Window isn't necessary since you're always checking 3 elements.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  (Loop through the array once.)
* **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  (No extra space used.)

## ðŸ”¹ Code Snippet (Optimized)

```java

class Solution {
    public int countSubarrays(int[] nums) {
        int count = 0;

        // Traverse from the second element to the second-last element
        for (int i = 1; i <= nums.length - 2; ++i) {

            // Sum of immediate neighbors
            int sum = nums[i - 1] + nums[i + 1];

            // Using multiplication instead of division for speed
            if (2 * nums[i] == sum) {
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}

```

# ðŸŒŸ **Extra sauce (Pro Tip)**

You can even *one-line* it if you want absolute minimalistic code:

```java
java
CopyEdit
if (2 * nums[i] == nums[i-1] + nums[i+1]) count++;

```

but it's your call â€” **clarity beats cleverness** most of the time.
