# 🔹 Problem Name: Daily Temperatures (Array/Stack, Medium)

**🔗 Link:** [LeetCode Problem #739 - Daily Temperatures](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/description/)

**🟢 Status:** ✅ Solved

## 🔹Quick Breakdown

* **Difficulty Level:** Medium
* **Main Approach:** Monotonic Stack
* **Core Concept:** Stack for Next Greater Element (NGE) problems
* **When to Use This Pattern?**
  * When you need to find the next greater/smaller element for every element in a list/array, especially with “days until” or “distance to” type questions.
* **Mistakes to Avoid:**
  * Confusing stack values vs. indices—store indices, not values.
  * Forgetting to pop and update all relevant elements when a warmer temperature is found.

## 🔹 Optimization Path

* **Brute Force:** O(n²), check for each day by scanning all future days.
* **Optimized Solution:** O(n) using a monotonic stack.
* **Further Improvements Possible?**
  * Not really, O(n) is optimal for this class of problems.

## 🔹 Solution Breakdown

* **Optimal Approach:**
  Use a **monotonic decreasing stack** to track the indices of unresolved days; when a warmer day is found, calculate the difference and fill the answer.
* **Why This Works?**
  The stack ensures that each index is processed only when a warmer temperature appears, guaranteeing each element is pushed and popped at most once (O(n)).
* **Edge Cases Considered:**
  * No warmer days ahead (remain 0).
  * All temperatures are decreasing (all zeros).

## 🔹 Pattern Recognition

* **Belongs To:**
  * Monotonic Stack / Next Greater Element
* **Common Problems Using This:**
  * Next Greater Element I/II
  * Stock Span Problem
  * Largest Rectangle in Histogram

## 🔹 Tricks & Patterns Used

* **Monotonic Stack**:
  Maintain indices of unresolved elements in order (decreasing or increasing based on problem).
* **Index Tracking**:
  Store indices, not values, for easy calculation of day gaps.

## 🔹 Alternative Data Structures

* **Can this problem be optimized using a different DS?**
  Not meaningfully for O(n) time. Queue or heap are not suitable for this kind of forward-looking problem.
* **Example:**
  Not applicable here; stack is the best fit.

## 🔹 Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(n)
* **Space Complexity:** O(n)

## 🔹 Code Snippet (Optimized)

```python

class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(temperatures)
        answer = [0] * n  # Stores days to wait for a warmer temperature
        stack = []  # Monotonic stack of indices (not values!)

        for idx in range(n):  # Start from index 0 to n-1
            # While the stack is not empty and the current temperature is higher than the temperature at the top index of the stack
            while stack and temperatures[idx] > temperatures[stack[-1]]:
                prev_idx = stack.pop()
                answer[prev_idx] = idx - prev_idx  # Calculate days waited
            # Push the current index onto the stack (to be resolved later)
            stack.append(idx)

        return answer

# Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of days/temperatures.
# Each index is pushed and popped at most once.
# Space complexity: O(n) for the answer list and the stack (in the worst case).

```
