# ðŸ”¹ Problem Name: Find Lucky Integer in an Array (Array, Easy)

**ðŸ”— Link:**[LeetCode 1394](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-lucky-integer-in-an-array/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-07-05)

**ðŸŸ¢ Status:** âœ… Solved

## ðŸ”¹Quick Breakdown

* **Difficulty Level:** Easy
* **Main Approach:** Frequency Map using `Counter`
* **Core Concept:** HashMap / Frequency Counting
* **When to Use This Pattern?**
  * When you need to **count occurrences** and **check conditions based on frequency**
* **Mistakes to Avoid:**
  * Forgetting to handle the case when no lucky number is found
  * Not using `max(lucky, num)` correctly to find the **largest** lucky integer

---

## ðŸ”¹ Optimization Path

* **Brute Force:**
  * Count each number manually with nested loops â†’ O(nÂ²)
* **Optimized Solution:**
  * Use `Counter` (hashmap) to count in O(n), then iterate â†’ **O(n)**
* **Further Improvements Possible?**
  * Not really needed; already optimal for the problem size

---

## ðŸ”¹ Solution Breakdown

* **Optimal Approach:**
  * Count the frequency of each number using `Counter`, then find the max number where `number == frequency`
* **Why This Works?**
  * You reduce the problem to **a map lookup and a filter condition**, and `Counter` handles counting efficiently
* **Edge Cases Considered:**
  * No lucky number at all â†’ return `1`
  * Multiple lucky numbers â†’ return the **largest one**

---

## ðŸ”¹ Pattern Recognition

* **Belongs To:**
  * HashMap Counting Pattern
* **Common Problems Using This:**
  * Majority Element
  * Top K Frequent Elements
  * Word Frequency
  * Valid Anagram

---

## ðŸ”¹ Tricks & Patterns Used

* **HashMap Frequency Counting** using `collections.Counter`
* `max()` with default value for safe computation

---

## ðŸ”¹ Alternative Data Structures

* **Can this problem be optimized using a different DS?**
  * Not necessary â€” hash map is optimal here
* **Example:**
  * You could use a regular dictionary with `.get()` but `Counter` is cleaner

---

## ðŸ”¹ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  * One pass to count frequencies
  * One pass to check and compare
* **Space Complexity:** O(k)
  * `k` = number of unique elements in array

## ðŸ”¹ Code Snippet (Optimized)

```python

from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def findLucky(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        # Count frequency of each element
        freq = Counter(arr)

        # Initialize lucky number to -1 (no lucky integer yet)
        lucky = -1

        # Traverse each (number, count) pair
        for num, count in freq.items():
            if num == count:
                # Update to the largest lucky integer found so far
                lucky = max(lucky, num)

        return lucky
    
```
