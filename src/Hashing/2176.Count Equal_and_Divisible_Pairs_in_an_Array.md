# ðŸ”¹ Problem Name: Count Pairs with Special Product Condition (Hashing + Number Theory)

**ðŸ”— Link:** [LeetCode 2176](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-equal-and-divisible-pairs-in-an-array/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2025-04-17)

**ðŸŸ¢ Status:** âœ… Solved

## ðŸ”¹Quick Breakdown

* **Difficulty Level:** Medium
* **Main Approach:** Efficient pair counting by leveraging **HashMap** to group values and **GCD** for fast pair matching with divisors.
* **Core Concept:****Hashing**, **Number Theory** (GCD and Divisors), **Optimized Pairing**
* **When to Use This Pattern?**
  * When counting pairs that satisfy a modular arithmetic condition.
  * When working with number-theory constraints (like divisors and GCD).
  * When brute force is too slow and you need to optimize using math.
* **Mistakes to Avoid:**
  * Forgetting that the condition `(i * j) % k == 0` can be broken into GCD properties.
  * Not using **factorization** to reduce the problem size.
  * Using a brute-force nested loop approach without optimizing with GCD and divisor logic.

## ðŸ”¹ Optimization Path

* **Brute Force:** O(nÂ²)
* **Optimized Solution:** O(n \* sqrt(k))
* **Further Improvements Possible?**
  * Potential improvements by precomputing factors of `k` once and avoiding repeated checks.

## ðŸ”¹ Solution Breakdown

* **Optimal Approach:** Use a **HashMap** to group indices of equal values. For each index, compute the **GCD** with `k` and use precomputed divisors to efficiently count pairs satisfying the condition `(i * j) % k == 0`.
* **Why This Works?** By leveraging number theory (GCD and divisors), we avoid checking all possible pairs. Instead, we reduce the problem to comparing indices where `gcd(i, k)` and its divisors satisfy the condition.
* **Edge Cases Considered:**
  * **Empty input array**: Return 0 pairs.
  * **Array with only one element**: No valid pairs (as `i < j` condition is never met).
  * **k = 1**: Every pair of indices will satisfy `(i * j) % 1 == 0`, so the solution will just count identical numbers efficiently.

## ðŸ”¹ Pattern Recognition

* **Belongs To:**
  * **Hashing** (HashMap for indexing values)
  * **Number Theory** (GCD, Divisor Enumeration)
  * **Optimized Pair Counting**
  * **Mathematical Transformation**
* **Common Problems Using This:**
  * Count pairs satisfying modular arithmetic conditions
  * Pair problems involving divisibility or factorization
  * Efficient counting problems using hashing and precomputations

## ðŸ”¹ Tricks & Patterns Used

* **Modulo Arithmetic / Bit Manipulation / Segment Trees**
  * Using the properties of **GCD** to efficiently pair indices with divisibility conditions.
  * **Divisor enumeration** to optimize counting of valid pairs.
* **Graph Theory (DFS, SCC, Bipartite, etc.)**
  * Not directly used in this problem, but some insights can be used in related pair problems.
* **Dynamic Programming Recurrence**
  * Not used in this problem, as this is not a classical DP problem.

## ðŸ”¹ Alternative Data Structures

* **Can this problem be optimized using a different DS?**
  * **Trie**: Not applicable here, as we are primarily concerned with divisibility and indexing, which isn't a direct fit for a Trie.
  * **Union-Find**: This could be useful if we had groups of numbers forming connected components, but not required for this problem.
  * **Heap**: Wouldnâ€™t be a good fit, as we are dealing with divisibility and pairing, which doesnâ€™t require priority-based selection.

## ðŸ”¹ Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** O(n \* sqrt(k))
  * **n** is the number of elements in the input array.
  * **sqrt(k)** is the time taken to compute all divisors of `k`.
  * The loop for each index processes its corresponding divisors and GCD in O(sqrt(k)) time, making the total time complexity O(n \* sqrt(k)).
* **Space Complexity:** O(n + sqrt(k))
  * The **HashMap** for storing indices takes up O(n) space.
  * The **HashSet** for storing divisors of `k` takes up O(sqrt(k)) space.

                int j = k / gcd;

                result += factorsMap.getOrDefault(j, 0);

                for (int f : div) {
